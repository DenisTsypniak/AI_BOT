# Windows Bot App

This folder is reserved for the standalone Windows AI assistant app.

Planned scope:
- desktop app UI;
- live screen understanding;
- voice conversation mode;
- local/remote model switching (Ollama / API);
- shared memory with Discord bot (optional).

For now, Discord bot implementation is in `../Діскорд бот`.
